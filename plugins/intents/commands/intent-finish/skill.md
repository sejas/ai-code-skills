# Intent Finish

You are helping the user mark an intent as complete.

## Workflow

1. Check `{CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER}/open/` for intents filtered by current repository:
   - Get base path: `echo "${CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER:-$HOME/.claude-intents}"`
   - Get current repository name: `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null) || basename $(pwd)`
   - List only intents where the folder name contains the current repository name
   - Intent folder format: `YYYY-mm-dd-{repository-name}-{intent-description}`
2. Ask which intent to mark as done (if multiple) or confirm the intent
3. Read the spec.md to understand the intent
4. Generate a **summary.md** file with a concise summary:
   - **Title**: Brief, clear title from the spec
   - **Problem**: Short description of the issue (1-2 sentences from spec's Problem section)
   - **Solution**: How it was fixed (2-3 bullet points from spec's Solution section)
   - **Key Changes**: List the main files/components modified
   - **Testing**: Steps to verify the fix
   - Keep it concise - this is a quick reference, not a copy of the full spec
5. Generate a **fix.diff** file with the changes made:
   - Run `git diff` from the main/master branch to capture all changes
   - Use: `git diff $(git rev-parse --verify main 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --verify master 2>/dev/null || echo HEAD~10)..HEAD`
   - If no git repo, skip this step and note that no diff is available
   - Save the raw diff output to `fix.diff`
6. Ask: "Was a PR created for this intent? If yes, provide the PR URL"
7. Ask: "Any final notes or learnings to document?"
8. Update the spec.md:
   - Change status from "In Progress" to "Completed"
   - Add completion date
   - Add PR link (if provided)
   - Add "## Completion Summary" section with final notes
9. Move the entire intent folder from `{CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER}/open/` to `{CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER}/done/`
10. Confirm the intent has been marked as complete and show the summary.md content

## Example spec.md update

```diff
- **Status:** In Progress
+ **Status:** Completed
+ **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
+ **PR:** [Link to PR](url)

+## Completion Summary
+[Final notes and learnings]
```

## Example summary.md format

```markdown
# [Title from spec]

## Problem
[Short description of the issue - 1-2 sentences]

## Solution
- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3

## Key Changes
- `path/to/file1.ts` - Description of change
- `path/to/file2.ts` - Description of change

## Testing
1. Step 1 to test
2. Step 2 to test
3. Expected result

## PR
[Link to PR](url) (if applicable)
```

## Example fix.diff

The `fix.diff` file contains the raw git diff output:

```diff
diff --git a/src/component.ts b/src/component.ts
index abc123..def456 100644
--- a/src/component.ts
+++ b/src/component.ts
@@ -10,6 +10,8 @@ export function example() {
+  // New code added
+  return result;
}
```

## Important Notes

- **CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER:** Use the `CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER` environment variable for the base path. Default is `~/.claude-intents` if not set.
- To get base path, run: `echo "${CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER:-$HOME/.claude-intents}"`
- **Repository filtering:** Only show intents that match the current repository name. Get repository name with: `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null) || basename $(pwd)`
- Intent folder naming format: `YYYY-mm-dd-{repository-name}-{intent-description}`
- Search for intents in `{CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER}/open/`
- Move completed intents to `{CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER}/done/`
- Create `{CLAUDE_INTENTS_FOLDER}/done/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Preserve all files when moving (spec.md, notes.md, summary.md, fix.diff)
- Show before/after path for confirmation
- The summary.md should be an extra short, concise summary - not a copy of the full spec
- The fix.diff captures all code changes for future reference
